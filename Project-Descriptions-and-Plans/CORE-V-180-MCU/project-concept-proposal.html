<h1>OpenHW Project Concept And Project Launch Markdown Template: Instructions</h1>
<p><em>This template is divided into two parts:</em> - <em>The</em><strong>Project Concept
(PC)</strong><em>required fields are shown in the first part.</em> - <em>The
additional</em><strong>Project Launch (PL)</strong><em>required and optional fields are
shown in the second part.</em></p>
<p><em>Delete any sections not needed for your proposal</em></p>
<p><em>The normal proposal flow is:</em> - <strong>The PC proposal</strong> <em>is prepared and
presented to TWG. The PC proposal introduces the project and explains
the market drivers and the “why”</em> - <em>TWG grants PC gate with feedback,
or rejects PC gate with feedback</em> - <em>If PC granted, additional work is
carried out to prepare the</em><strong>PL proposal</strong>. - <em>The</em><strong>PL
proposal</strong><em>contains updates to the PC fields and adds additional
fields. The PL proposal explains the “what” of the project.</em> - <em>For
software porting projects, the PL should contain the feature list</em> -
<em>For IP core or other complex projects, the PL should contain a high
level feature list (the user manual with feature specification is
developed for the Plan Approved gate).</em></p>

<h2>High Level Summary of project, project components, and deliverables</h2>
<p>This project is the creation of an updated version of the CORE-V-MCU in
a different process technology. The process is the GF-180 which is an
open-source PDK process. The flow from RTL to GSDII will use entirely
open source tooling with back-end (place and route, clock tree analysis,
etc.) developed by LIP6. Key outputs of the project include</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Revision/simplification of the CORE-V-MCU design so as to enable the
chip to fit within the area allowed under the GF180 shuttle process.</li>
<li>Verification goals to be determined</li>
<li>Digital synthesis using open-source (Yosys) tools</li>
<li>PLL will be developed/supplied by LIP6</li>
<li>Back-end design into the GF-180 process using open-source tools
developed and published by Sorbonne LIP6</li>
<li>Back-end design tool input (including scripts) as a minimum will be
part of the open-source project output</li>
<li>Layout can be published</li>
<li>The project will serve as a validation of the LIP6 tools. Specific
output (white paper, publication…) of the tool validation to be
determined.</li>
<li>Fabrication of the device</li>
<li>PCB creation for test purposes</li>
<li>Documentation of the device</li>
<li>Documentation of the open-source design/implementation process (to be
determined the role of OpenHW and LIP6 in this)</li>
</ul>
<p>Further development of software or applications on the PCB is for
further study.</p>
<p>The open-source tools utilized in the project will include: - tool1 ….</p>

<div class="section" id="who-would-make-use-of-openhw-output">
<h2>Who would make use of OpenHW output</h2>
<p>First and foremost, we believe that the chip can be used by universities
for teaching purposes.</p>
<p>Second, the device may be adopted or used as the basis of designs for
commerical purposes (e.g.&nbsp;small appliances or IoT applications). Small
business could adopt the chip baseline design together with the open
source scripts and easily modify the chip as needed.</p>
<p>To support the second goal, obviously documentation of the “how-to” for
the design tools is very important.</p>
<p>As described in “why”</p>

<div class="section" id="initial-estimate-of-timeline">
<h2>Initial Estimate of Timeline</h2>
<p>At the project concept phase, an initial target of 1 year to undertake
the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>tradeoff of features and available space, understanding potential
applications</li>
<li>design exploration of IP blocks and sources: – GF external SRAM –
LIP6 SRAM – chips4makers</li>
<li>Implement the CORE-V-MCU</li>
<li>Layout &amp; layout verification/signoff</li>
<li>Fabrication</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="explanation-of-why-openhw-should-do-this-project">
<h2>Explanation of why OpenHW should do this project</h2>
<p>This project is an ecosystem-enabling effort. From the perspective of
small companies needing to design and fabricate a chip, cost barriers
include (i) Design tools and design costs (ii) IP licensing costs (iii)
fabrication costs</p>
<p>While OpenHW is already providing open-source cores and related IP which
are free of license costs, implementation costs can be very high,
particularly EDA tools. This project validates the use of open-source
back-end tools from LIP6 which can potentially be a game-changer. This
complements OpenHW’s open-source mission.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/google/gf180mcu-pdk">https://github.com/google/gf180mcu-pdk</a> In short</p>
<p>“The GF180MCU open source PDK is a collaboration between Google and
GlobalFoundries to provide a fully open source process design kit (PDK)
and related resources to enable the creation of designs manufacturable
at GlobalFoundries’s facility on their 0.18um 3.3V/6V MCU process
technology.” As of April 2023, the GF180 is targetted at test chips.</p>
